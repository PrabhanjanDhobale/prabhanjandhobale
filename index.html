                                                using Tableau to identify trends, patterns, and relationships in the
                                                data. Different types of visualisations, such as bar charts, line
                                                charts, heat maps, and scatterplots, will be used to explore the data
                                                and identify insights.</li>
                                            <li>Dashboard Creation: In this phase, dashboards will be created using
                                                Tableau to summarize and present the insights gained from the data
                                                visualization. The dashboards will provide a high-level view of the
                                                airline industry in India, including information on the number of

                                            <li>Reporting: In this final phase, the findings of the analysis will be
                                                presented in the form of reports generated by Tableau. The objective
                                                will be to communicate the insights gained from the analysis to
                                                stakeholders, including airlines, airports, policymakers, and the

                                        airline industry in India using Tableau and will help inform decision-making by
                                        key stakeholders in the industry. The use of Tableau will allow for the creation
                                        of interactive visualisations and dashboards that will facilitate a better
                                        understanding and interpretation of the data.

                                        involves analysing sales data from a retail store that sells a wide range of
                                        products in different geographic locations. The main goal of the analysis is to
                                        identify patterns and trends in the sales data that can help the store make more
                                        informed business decisions and optimize its operations.
                                        <br />We used Microsoft power bi tool to extract insights from the data. Here
                                        are some tasks performed on Superstore sales analysis project:

                                            <li>Product analysis: This involves analysing the sales data for each
                                                product category to determine which products are selling the most, which
                                                products have the highest profit margins, and which products are not
                                                selling well. This analysis can help the store determine which products
                                                to stock more of, which products to discontinue, and which products to

                                                generating the most revenue and profit. This analysis can help the store
                                                to determine which locations to focus on and which locations may need
                                                improvement.</li>
                                            <li>Discount analysis: This involves analysing the discount data to
                                                determine the impact of discounts on sales revenue and profit margins.
                                                This analysis can help the store determine the optimal discount level
                                                for different products and geographic locations.</li>

                                                in sales revenue, profit margins, and customer behaviour. This analysis
                                                can help the store determine which regions are the most profitable,
                                                which regions have the most potential for growth, and how to target
